## Hook Manager

The `hook-manager.py` script provides a command-line interface for managing and executing hooks:

### Usage Examples

```bash
# List all available hooks
uv run python .kiro/hooks/hook-manager.py --list

# Get information about a specific hook
uv run python .kiro/hooks/hook-manager.py --info automated-testing

# Execute a specific hook
uv run python .kiro/hooks/hook-manager.py --execute code-quality-checks

# Execute all applicable hooks (dry run)
uv run python .kiro/hooks/hook-manager.py --execute-all --dry-run

# Execute hooks for specific files and branch
uv run python .kiro/hooks/hook-manager.py --execute-all \
  --changed-files src/forkscout/analysis/analyzer.py tests/unit/test_analyzer.py \
  --branch feature/new-analysis --event pre_commit
```

### Git Integration

The `git-integration.sh` script provides seamless integration with Git workflows:

```bash
# Run as pre-commit hook
.kiro/hooks/git-integration.sh pre-commit

# Run as pre-push hook  
.kiro/hooks/git-integration.sh pre-push

# Manual execution with dry run
.kiro/hooks/git-integration.sh manual --dry-run

# CI/CD integration
.kiro/hooks/git-integration.sh ci build
```

## Integration with Kiro Development Process

### Specs → Hooks → Implementation

The hooks demonstrate sophisticated integration with the Kiro development process:

1. **Spec-Driven Triggers**: Hooks are triggered by changes to spec files, ensuring documentation stays current
2. **Steering Rule Enforcement**: Code quality hooks enforce the standards defined in steering rules
3. **Automated Validation**: Spec validation hooks ensure consistency across the 14+ specs in the project
4. **AI-Assisted Improvements**: Hooks leverage AI to generate documentation, suggest fixes, and optimize code

### Development Velocity Improvements

The hooks have significantly improved development velocity by:

- **Reducing Manual Tasks**: Automated formatting, testing, and documentation updates
- **Early Problem Detection**: Issues caught immediately rather than during code review
- **Consistent Quality**: Automated enforcement of coding standards and best practices
- **Intelligent Automation**: AI-powered suggestions and fixes reduce debugging time

### Quality Assurance Integration

Hooks integrate with the project's quality assurance process:

- **Multi-Level Testing**: Unit, integration, contract, and online tests
- **Coverage Enforcement**: Minimum 85% test coverage requirement
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection
- **Performance Monitoring**: Performance test integration for critical changes
