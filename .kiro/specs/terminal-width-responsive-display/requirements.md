# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the issue where table columns become truncated and display incorrectly when the terminal width is narrow. Currently, when running forklift commands in narrow terminals, the Rich library automatically constrains table width to fit the terminal, causing column content to be truncated and table structure to break. The solution is to disable automatic width constraints and allow tables to render at their natural width, letting the terminal handle horizontal scrolling natively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Natural Table Width Rendering

**User Story:** As a user, I want tables to render at their natural width regardless of terminal size, so that all content is displayed without truncation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying tables THEN column widths SHALL be calculated based on content, not terminal width
2. WHEN terminal is narrow THEN table width SHALL not be constrained to fit the terminal
3. WHEN columns contain long content THEN they SHALL display at their natural width
4. WHEN table exceeds terminal width THEN the terminal SHALL handle horizontal scrolling natively

### Requirement 2: Disable Automatic Width Constraints

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Rich library to stop automatically constraining table width, so that tables don't get compressed and broken in narrow terminals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Rich detects narrow terminal width THEN it SHALL NOT automatically reduce table width
2. WHEN rendering tables THEN Rich SHALL use unlimited or very large width limits
3. WHEN table formatting occurs THEN column content SHALL not be truncated to fit terminal
4. WHEN displaying in any terminal size THEN table structure SHALL remain intact

### Requirement 3: Preserve All Content

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all content in full without any truncation, so that I don't lose important information due to display constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying commit messages THEN they SHALL appear in full length without truncation
2. WHEN showing URLs THEN they SHALL be displayed completely without cutting
3. WHEN content is long THEN it SHALL be fully visible (terminal scrolling permitting)
4. WHEN viewing any column THEN all original content SHALL be preserved and displayed

### Requirement 4: Consistent Table Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want table structure to remain consistent regardless of terminal width, so that the display is predictable and properly formatted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terminal width changes THEN table column alignment SHALL remain correct
2. WHEN displaying tables THEN column separators SHALL not overlap or break
3. WHEN content varies THEN table borders and formatting SHALL remain intact
4. WHEN viewing output THEN table headers SHALL align properly with content

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want all current functionality to work unchanged, so that my existing workflows continue to function properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in wide terminals THEN the display SHALL be identical to current behavior
2. WHEN using existing command flags THEN they SHALL continue to work as expected
3. WHEN output is redirected THEN file output SHALL not be affected by width changes
4. WHEN terminal width is sufficient THEN no visual changes SHALL be apparent
