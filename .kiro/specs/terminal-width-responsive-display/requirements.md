# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses a critical bug in the Forkscout tool where the `show-repo` command generates output tables with infinite width (999999 characters), causing the terminal to become unresponsive and potentially crash. The issue stems from hardcoded console width values in the `RepositoryDisplayService` class that were intended to prevent table truncation but instead create unusable output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Terminal Width Detection and Responsive Display

**User Story:** As a user running `forkscout show-repo`, I want the output to be properly sized for my terminal so that I can read the information without the terminal becoming unresponsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `forkscout show-repo <url>` in a terminal THEN the system SHALL detect the actual terminal width and format tables accordingly
2. WHEN the terminal width is detected THEN the system SHALL use a maximum width that fits within the terminal boundaries
3. WHEN the terminal width cannot be detected THEN the system SHALL use a reasonable default width (e.g., 120 characters)
4. WHEN output is redirected to a file THEN the system SHALL use a wider but still reasonable width (e.g., 200 characters) instead of infinite width

### Requirement 2: Console Width Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the console width to be configurable and responsive to different output contexts so that the display works correctly in all scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initializes the console THEN it SHALL determine the appropriate width based on the output context
2. WHEN running in an interactive terminal THEN the system SHALL use the terminal's actual width or a reasonable maximum
3. WHEN output is redirected to a file THEN the system SHALL use a wider but finite width suitable for file output
4. WHEN running in a CI/CD environment THEN the system SHALL use a standard width that works across different systems

### Requirement 3: Table Rendering Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want repository information tables to be readable and properly formatted regardless of my terminal size or output method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tables are rendered THEN they SHALL fit within the determined console width
2. WHEN table content exceeds the available width THEN the system SHALL use appropriate truncation or wrapping strategies
3. WHEN columns contain long text THEN the system SHALL apply intelligent text overflow handling
4. WHEN displaying repository details THEN all information SHALL remain accessible and readable

### Requirement 4: Progress Bar and Output Separation

**User Story:** As a user, I want progress indicators to not interfere with the main output when using output redirection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN output is redirected to a file THEN progress bars SHALL be sent to stderr with appropriate width
2. WHEN running interactively THEN progress bars SHALL use the same console as the main output
3. WHEN progress bars are displayed THEN they SHALL not cause width-related issues
4. WHEN the command completes THEN the output file SHALL contain only the intended content without progress artifacts

### Requirement 5: Error Prevention and Graceful Degradation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle width detection failures gracefully without causing terminal issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terminal width detection fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to safe default values
2. WHEN console initialization encounters errors THEN the system SHALL continue with basic console functionality
3. WHEN width values are invalid THEN the system SHALL sanitize them to reasonable bounds
4. WHEN the system cannot determine the output context THEN it SHALL assume the safest configuration
