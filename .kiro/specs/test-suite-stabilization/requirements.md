# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The test suite currently has 308 failing tests across multiple categories after the test-freezing-fix was completed. These failures indicate systematic issues with method signatures, missing imports, validation errors, and mock configurations that need to be addressed to restore a stable, reliable test suite.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all method signature mismatches to be resolved, so that tests can properly call the methods they're testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests call `_fetch_commits_concurrently` THEN it SHALL have the correct parameters including `base_owner` and `base_repo`
2. WHEN tests call repository display methods THEN they SHALL match the current method signatures
3. WHEN method signatures change THEN all test calls SHALL be updated accordingly
4. WHEN tests run THEN there SHALL be no `TypeError` exceptions due to missing required arguments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all missing imports and undefined names to be resolved, so that tests can execute without import errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests reference `CLIError` THEN it SHALL be properly imported from the correct module
2. WHEN tests reference `table_context` THEN it SHALL be properly defined or imported
3. WHEN tests reference `CommitDataFormatter` THEN it SHALL be available from the correct module
4. WHEN tests reference model classes THEN they SHALL be imported from their current locations
5. WHEN tests run THEN there SHALL be no `NameError` or `ImportError` exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Pydantic validation errors to be resolved, so that data models work correctly in tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests create `Repository` models THEN they SHALL include all required fields
2. WHEN tests create `Commit` models THEN they SHALL have valid `url` fields
3. WHEN tests create `ForkQualificationMetrics` THEN they SHALL have all required validation fields
4. WHEN tests create model instances THEN they SHALL pass Pydantic validation
5. WHEN model schemas change THEN test data SHALL be updated to match

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all mock configuration issues to be resolved, so that tests properly simulate external dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests use async mocks THEN they SHALL be properly configured with `AsyncMock`
2. WHEN tests mock GitHub API calls THEN they SHALL return properly structured responses
3. WHEN tests mock file operations THEN they SHALL handle async operations correctly
4. WHEN tests use mocks THEN there SHALL be no "coroutine was never awaited" warnings
5. WHEN mocks are configured THEN they SHALL match the expected interface of the real objects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want contract tests to pass, so that API interfaces remain stable and compatible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contract tests run THEN they SHALL validate current API interfaces
2. WHEN model contracts are tested THEN they SHALL reflect actual model requirements
3. WHEN method contracts are tested THEN they SHALL match current method signatures
4. WHEN API changes occur THEN contract tests SHALL be updated to reflect new contracts
5. WHEN backward compatibility is required THEN contract tests SHALL enforce it

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CSV export tests to pass, so that data export functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSV export tests run THEN they SHALL use correct column names and data structures
2. WHEN CSV data is exported THEN it SHALL match expected format and content
3. WHEN CSV export handles special characters THEN it SHALL properly escape them
4. WHEN CSV export processes large datasets THEN it SHALL complete without errors
5. WHEN CSV configuration changes THEN tests SHALL reflect the new configuration

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want display and formatting tests to pass, so that user interface components work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN display tests run THEN they SHALL use correct emoji and formatting patterns
2. WHEN table formatting is tested THEN it SHALL match current display logic
3. WHEN compact display modes are tested THEN they SHALL work with current implementations
4. WHEN terminal width detection is tested THEN it SHALL handle different environments
5. WHEN rich console formatting is tested THEN it SHALL produce expected output

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want performance and integration tests to pass, so that system performance and component integration are validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance tests run THEN they SHALL have realistic performance expectations
2. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL properly coordinate between components
3. WHEN end-to-end tests run THEN they SHALL simulate realistic user workflows
4. WHEN optimization tests run THEN they SHALL validate actual optimization benefits
5. WHEN concurrent processing is tested THEN it SHALL handle real concurrency scenarios

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the test suite to run efficiently and provide clear feedback, so that development velocity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full test suite runs THEN it SHALL complete in under 10 minutes
2. WHEN tests fail THEN they SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN tests are categorized THEN each category SHALL be runnable independently
4. WHEN tests are fixed THEN the fix SHALL not break other tests
5. WHEN the test suite is stable THEN it SHALL have less than 5% flaky tests
