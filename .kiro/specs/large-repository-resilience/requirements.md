# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the challenges of analyzing very large repositories (>2000 forks) where the current circuit breaker and rate limiting mechanisms prevent successful completion of analysis. The system currently fails when processing large repositories due to circuit breaker opening after consecutive API failures, leaving users with incomplete results and no way to resume processing.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Resilient Circuit Breaker for Large Repositories

**User Story:** As a developer analyzing popular repositories with thousands of forks, I want the system to handle API failures gracefully without completely stopping the analysis, so that I can get results for as many forks as possible even when some fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing repositories with >1000 forks THEN the system SHALL use a more lenient circuit breaker configuration that allows for higher failure rates
2. WHEN the circuit breaker opens THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining forks after the timeout period instead of terminating the entire analysis
3. WHEN API failures occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between different failure types (rate limits, network errors, repository access issues) and handle them appropriately
4. WHEN processing large fork lists THEN the system SHALL implement progressive backoff that increases delays based on consecutive failures rather than immediately opening the circuit breaker

### Requirement 2: Batch Processing with Failure Recovery

**User Story:** As a user analyzing large repositories, I want the system to process forks in batches and recover from failures, so that temporary issues don't prevent me from getting results for the majority of forks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing >500 forks THEN the system SHALL divide the work into configurable batch sizes (default 100 forks per batch)
2. WHEN a batch fails THEN the system SHALL retry the batch with exponential backoff up to 3 times before marking individual forks as failed
3. WHEN individual fork analysis fails THEN the system SHALL continue with the next fork and report the failure in the final results
4. WHEN the circuit breaker opens during batch processing THEN the system SHALL pause processing, wait for the circuit to reset, and resume with the next batch

### Requirement 3: Adaptive Rate Limiting for Large Scale Operations

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the rate limiting to adapt to large-scale operations, so that the system can efficiently process thousands of forks without hitting GitHub's rate limits unnecessarily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing >1000 forks THEN the system SHALL implement adaptive rate limiting that adjusts delays based on remaining API quota
2. WHEN GitHub rate limit headers indicate low remaining quota THEN the system SHALL automatically increase delays between requests
3. WHEN processing commits ahead comparisons THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent batching to minimize API calls while maintaining accuracy
4. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL wait for the reset time and resume processing rather than failing completely

### Requirement 4: Progress Tracking and Resumable Operations

**User Story:** As a user running long-running analysis on large repositories, I want to see progress updates and be able to resume if the operation is interrupted, so that I don't lose hours of processing time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing >500 forks THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators showing completed/total forks and estimated time remaining
2. WHEN analysis is interrupted THEN the system SHALL save progress state to allow resuming from the last completed batch
3. WHEN resuming analysis THEN the system SHALL skip already processed forks and continue from where it left off
4. WHEN circuit breaker events occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about failures and recovery attempts for debugging

### Requirement 5: Configurable Resilience Parameters

**User Story:** As a power user analyzing different types of repositories, I want to configure the resilience parameters, so that I can optimize the analysis for different repository sizes and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running forklift THEN the system SHALL accept command-line options to configure circuit breaker thresholds, batch sizes, and retry counts
2. WHEN processing repositories of different sizes THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust default parameters based on the number of forks detected
3. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN users SHALL be able to increase timeout values and retry counts through configuration
4. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging options that show circuit breaker state changes and retry attempts
