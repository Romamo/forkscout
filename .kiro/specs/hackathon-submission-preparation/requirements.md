# Hackathon Submission Preparation Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for preparing the Forkscout project for submission to the Code with Kiro Hackathon. Forkscout is a sophisticated GitHub repository fork analysis tool that demonstrates advanced spec-driven development using Kiro. The project needs final completion of core features, comprehensive documentation of the Kiro development process, and preparation of submission materials.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Ensure Production-Ready Version 1.0

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see a fully functional, polished tool that demonstrates its core value proposition through reliable fork analysis capabilities, so that I can evaluate the implementation quality and practical utility.

2. WHEN the test suite is validated THEN all tests SHALL pass consistently demonstrating system reliability
3. WHEN the existing features are polished THEN they SHALL work smoothly without errors or performance issues
4. WHEN the tool is demonstrated THEN it SHALL show clear value for repository maintainers through working fork discovery, analysis, and basic reporting capabilities

**Note:** This requirement focuses on polishing and validating the existing 75% complete functionality rather than adding new features.

### Requirement 2: Create Comprehensive Hackathon Documentation

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to understand how Kiro was used throughout the development process, so that I can evaluate the effective use of Kiro's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the development process is documented THEN it SHALL show examples of requirements → design → tasks → implementation workflow
3. WHEN the steering rules usage is documented THEN it SHALL explain how the 19 steering files guided development decisions
4. WHEN the agent hooks usage is documented THEN it SHALL demonstrate any automated workflows created with Kiro
5. WHEN the spec evolution is documented THEN it SHALL show how 14 different specs were used to build different features incrementally

### Requirement 3: Create Professional Demo Video

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to see a compelling 3-minute demonstration of the tool and its development with Kiro, so that I can understand both the final product and the development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the demo video is created THEN it SHALL be exactly 3 minutes or less in duration
2. WHEN the tool demonstration is shown THEN it SHALL showcase the complete fork analysis workflow from discovery to PR creation
3. WHEN the Kiro development process is demonstrated THEN it SHALL show specific examples of spec-driven development in action
4. WHEN the video is produced THEN it SHALL be uploaded to YouTube/Vimeo and made public
5. WHEN the video quality is assessed THEN it SHALL be professional quality with clear audio and visual presentation

### Requirement 4: Prepare PyPI Package Distribution

**User Story:** As a potential user, I want to easily install Forkscout from PyPI, so that I can use the tool without complex setup procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package is prepared for PyPI THEN it SHALL include proper setup.py/pyproject.toml configuration
2. WHEN the package metadata is configured THEN it SHALL include comprehensive description, keywords, and classifiers
3. WHEN the package is built THEN it SHALL include all necessary dependencies and entry points
4. WHEN the package is tested THEN it SHALL install and run correctly from PyPI
5. WHEN the package is published THEN it SHALL be available on PyPI with proper versioning

### Requirement 5: Create Hackathon Submission Materials

**User Story:** As a hackathon organizer, I want to receive complete submission materials that clearly demonstrate the project's value and Kiro usage, so that I can properly evaluate the submission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the submission README is created THEN it SHALL clearly identify the project category (Productivity & Workflow Tools)
2. WHEN the Kiro usage writeup is completed THEN it SHALL provide specific examples of how Kiro improved the development process
3. WHEN the project value is documented THEN it SHALL explain the potential impact and usefulness of the tool
4. WHEN the implementation quality is showcased THEN it SHALL highlight the sophisticated architecture and comprehensive testing
5. WHEN the submission is finalized THEN it SHALL include all required materials: video, repository, writeup, and category identification

### Requirement 6: Optimize Project for Demonstration

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to easily understand and test the project, so that I can quickly evaluate its functionality and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project setup is optimized THEN it SHALL have a simple one-command installation process
2. WHEN the demo examples are prepared THEN they SHALL showcase the tool's capabilities with well-known repositories
3. WHEN the documentation is polished THEN it SHALL provide clear quick-start instructions for judges
4. WHEN the project structure is cleaned THEN it SHALL remove temporary files and focus on production-ready code
5. WHEN the testing is verified THEN all tests SHALL pass and demonstrate the project's reliability

### Requirement 7: Showcase Advanced Kiro Features

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge evaluating Kiro usage, I want to see advanced features like agent hooks, steering rules, and spec evolution, so that I can assess the sophisticated use of Kiro's capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent hooks are implemented THEN they SHALL demonstrate automated development workflows
2. WHEN steering rules usage is documented THEN it SHALL show how 19 different steering files guided consistent development practices
3. WHEN spec evolution is showcased THEN it SHALL demonstrate how 14 different specs enabled incremental feature development
4. WHEN advanced Kiro features are highlighted THEN they SHALL show integration between specs, hooks, and steering for comprehensive development automation
5. WHEN the Kiro mastery is demonstrated THEN it SHALL show how the tool enabled building a complex, production-ready application through AI-assisted development

### Requirement 8: Document Kiro's Contribution and Team Roles

**User Story:** As a hackathon judge, I want to understand exactly what parts of the project were created with Kiro assistance and the role of each team member, so that I can properly evaluate the AI-assisted development process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kiro's contributions are documented THEN it SHALL specify which components, features, and code sections were generated or enhanced by Kiro
2. WHEN the development breakdown is provided THEN it SHALL show the percentage of code/features that were Kiro-assisted vs manually written
3. WHEN team member roles are documented THEN it SHALL clearly identify each team member's specific contributions and responsibilities
4. WHEN the collaboration process is explained THEN it SHALL describe how team members worked with Kiro to achieve the final result
5. WHEN the AI assistance impact is quantified THEN it SHALL demonstrate how Kiro accelerated development and improved code quality
6. WHEN the human-AI collaboration is showcased THEN it SHALL highlight the synergy between human creativity and AI implementation capabilities

### Requirement 9: Reference Future Development Vision

**User Story:** As a potential user or contributor, I want to understand that the project has a long-term vision beyond the hackathon submission, so that I can see the potential for continued development and contribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the submission materials reference future development THEN they SHALL mention the existence of a Version 2.0 specification with advanced features
2. WHEN the project vision is communicated THEN it SHALL show that Version 1.0 provides a solid foundation for future enhancements
3. WHEN long-term potential is discussed THEN it SHALL reference advanced features like PR automation, enhanced ranking, and enterprise integration without requiring their implementation
4. WHEN the roadmap is mentioned THEN it SHALL demonstrate thoughtful planning and sustainable development approach
5. WHEN future versions are referenced THEN they SHALL show how the current architecture enables advanced capabilities
