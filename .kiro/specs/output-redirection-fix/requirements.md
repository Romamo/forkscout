# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses the issue where output redirection using `>` (stdout redirection) only captures a single line of output instead of the complete program output. The problem occurs because the application uses a mix of output methods: Rich console (which writes to stderr by default), direct print() statements (which write to stdout), and potentially has buffering issues that prevent all output from being captured when redirected to a file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Output Redirection Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to redirect all program output to a file using `> filename.txt`, so that I can capture the complete program output for analysis or sharing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs any forklift command with stdout redirection (`> file.txt`) THEN all visible program output SHALL be captured in the file
2. WHEN Rich console messages are displayed (progress, status, tables, etc.) THEN they SHALL be written to stdout instead of stderr
3. WHEN direct print() statements are used THEN they SHALL be properly flushed to ensure capture
4. WHEN the program completes THEN all output SHALL be present in the redirected file

### Requirement 2: Consistent Output Stream Usage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all program output to use a consistent method, so that redirection works reliably across all features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initializing Rich Console objects THEN they SHALL be configured to write to stdout (file=sys.stdout)
2. WHEN using progress indicators THEN they SHALL write to stdout instead of using direct print() with flush
3. WHEN displaying status messages THEN they SHALL use the same output method as other program output
4. WHEN error conditions occur THEN error messages SHALL still be written to stderr to maintain proper error handling

### Requirement 3: Output Buffering Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want all program output to be properly flushed, so that redirection captures everything even if the program terminates early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using stdout for output THEN it SHALL be properly flushed at appropriate intervals
2. WHEN the program terminates THEN all buffered output SHALL be flushed before exit
3. WHEN using mixed output methods THEN they SHALL be synchronized to prevent partial capture
4. WHEN long-running operations occur THEN output SHALL be flushed periodically to show progress

### Requirement 4: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want the program to behave the same way visually, so that my existing workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running commands without redirection THEN the visual output SHALL be identical to current behavior
2. WHEN using interactive features THEN they SHALL continue to work as expected
3. WHEN error handling occurs THEN it SHALL maintain the same behavior as before
4. WHEN progress bars and status messages are shown THEN they SHALL appear the same to the user

### Requirement 5: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want comprehensive tests for output redirection, so that I can ensure the fix works correctly and doesn't break in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running automated tests THEN they SHALL verify that stdout redirection captures all expected output
2. WHEN testing error conditions THEN they SHALL verify that errors still go to stderr
3. WHEN testing different command combinations THEN they SHALL verify consistent redirection behavior
4. WHEN running integration tests THEN they SHALL test real-world redirection scenarios with complete output capture
