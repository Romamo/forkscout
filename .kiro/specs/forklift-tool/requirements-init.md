# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Forklift tool is a GitHub repository analysis system built with Python 3.12 and managed using uv package manager that **automatically discovers and evaluates valuable features across all forks** of a repository. It scans forks to identify meaningful changes, ranks them by value and impact, generates comprehensive reports for maintainers, and can automatically create pull requests to propose the most valuable features back to the upstream repository. This tool aims to help open source maintainers discover and integrate valuable contributions that might otherwise be lost in the ecosystem of forks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to scan all forks of my repository, so that I can discover valuable features and improvements that contributors have made.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a GitHub repository URL THEN the system SHALL discover and list all public forks of that repository
2. WHEN scanning forks THEN the system SHALL **identify commits** that are ahead of the upstream repository
3. WHEN analyzing fork commits THEN the system SHALL exclude merge commits and focus on original contributions
4. IF a fork has no unique commits THEN the system SHALL skip it from further analysis
5. WHEN accessing GitHub data THEN the system SHALL handle API rate limits gracefully with appropriate backoff strategies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the tool to rank discovered features by value and impact, so that I can prioritize which contributions to review first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing fork changes THEN the system SHALL calculate a value score based on multiple factors including code quality, test coverage, documentation, and community engagement
2. WHEN ranking features THEN the system SHALL consider the number of stars, forks, and activity on the contributing fork
3. WHEN evaluating commits THEN the system SHALL analyze commit messages, code changes, and file modifications to determine feature significance
4. WHEN multiple forks implement similar features THEN the system SHALL identify and group related implementations
5. WHEN scoring features THEN the system SHALL provide a numerical ranking from 1-100 with clear scoring criteria

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to receive a human-readable report of valuable features, so that I can quickly understand what improvements are available across forks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report in markdown format
2. WHEN creating the report THEN the system SHALL include feature summaries, code snippets, and links to the original fork implementations
3. WHEN presenting features THEN the system SHALL organize them by category (bug fixes, new features, performance improvements, documentation)
4. WHEN showing rankings THEN the system SHALL display the top 20 most valuable features with detailed explanations of their scores
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include metadata about each fork including author, last activity, and fork statistics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the tool to automatically create pull requests for the most valuable features, so that I can efficiently integrate improvements without manual setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured for automatic PR creation THEN the system SHALL create pull requests for features scoring above a specified threshold
2. WHEN creating pull requests THEN the system SHALL include detailed descriptions explaining the feature value and origin
3. WHEN submitting PRs THEN the system SHALL properly attribute the original author and link to the source fork
4. WHEN creating pull requests THEN the system SHALL handle merge conflicts by creating draft PRs with conflict notifications
5. IF the upstream repository has specific contribution guidelines THEN the system SHALL format PRs according to those requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to configure the tool's behavior and thresholds, so that I can customize the analysis to match my project's needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the tool THEN the system SHALL support configuration files to specify analysis parameters
2. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL allow setting minimum score thresholds for automatic PR creation
3. WHEN customizing analysis THEN the system SHALL support excluding specific file types or directories from consideration
4. WHEN setting up THEN the system SHALL allow specifying GitHub authentication tokens and repository access permissions
5. WHEN running analysis THEN the system SHALL support both one-time scans and scheduled recurring analysis

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want the tool to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand the analysis process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering API errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error messages and continue processing other forks
2. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
3. WHEN analysis fails for a specific fork THEN the system SHALL record the failure reason and continue with remaining forks
4. WHEN running THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators showing current analysis status
5. WHEN complete THEN the system SHALL generate a summary report including any errors or warnings encountered during analysis
