# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification documents a comprehensive review of the Forkscout project to assess completeness, identify critical missing features, evaluate excess functionality, and provide recommendations for project optimization. The review covers code quality, test coverage, documentation completeness, and overall project health to ensure the tool meets its intended purpose as a GitHub repository fork analysis system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want a comprehensive assessment of project completeness, so that I can understand what critical features are missing and what excess functionality should be removed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the project THEN the system SHALL identify all incomplete critical features that prevent the tool from fulfilling its core purpose
2. WHEN analyzing functionality THEN the system SHALL identify excess files, unused code, and redundant implementations that should be removed
3. WHEN evaluating features THEN the system SHALL assess whether each component contributes to the core value proposition
4. WHEN reviewing specifications THEN the system SHALL identify incomplete specs with missing design or task documents
5. WHEN analyzing tasks THEN the system SHALL count incomplete tasks across all specifications and prioritize by criticality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want an assessment of code quality and technical debt, so that I can prioritize cleanup and improvement efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing source code THEN the system SHALL identify TODO comments, deprecated code, and technical debt markers
2. WHEN analyzing code structure THEN the system SHALL evaluate adherence to established patterns and conventions
3. WHEN reviewing error handling THEN the system SHALL assess robustness and user experience quality
4. WHEN evaluating performance THEN the system SHALL identify potential bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
5. WHEN assessing maintainability THEN the system SHALL evaluate code organization, documentation, and testing practices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want an evaluation of test coverage and quality, so that I can ensure the tool is reliable and well-tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing test coverage THEN the system SHALL report current coverage percentages across all modules
2. WHEN reviewing test quality THEN the system SHALL identify gaps in unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
3. WHEN evaluating test reliability THEN the system SHALL identify flaky tests and collection errors
4. WHEN assessing test organization THEN the system SHALL evaluate test structure and maintainability
5. WHEN reviewing test data THEN the system SHALL ensure tests use appropriate mock data and real data validation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want recommendations for project optimization, so that I can focus development efforts on the most impactful improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical missing features that block core functionality
2. WHEN suggesting improvements THEN the system SHALL identify quick wins that provide immediate value
3. WHEN recommending cleanup THEN the system SHALL specify which files and code can be safely removed
4. WHEN prioritizing work THEN the system SHALL consider user impact, development effort, and technical risk
5. WHEN creating action plans THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable steps with clear success criteria

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want an assessment of documentation completeness, so that I can ensure users and contributors have adequate guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL evaluate README completeness and accuracy
2. WHEN analyzing API documentation THEN the system SHALL identify missing or outdated function/class documentation
3. WHEN reviewing user guides THEN the system SHALL assess whether documentation matches actual functionality
4. WHEN evaluating contributor documentation THEN the system SHALL identify gaps in development setup and contribution guidelines
5. WHEN assessing examples THEN the system SHALL verify that provided examples work with current implementation
