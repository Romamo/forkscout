  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_

## Current Project Status Summary

Based on initial analysis, the Forklift project shows:

### Strengths
- **Comprehensive CLI Interface**: 71 Python files with extensive command structure
- **Extensive Testing**: 3,083 tests across 179 test files with good coverage
- **Rich Documentation**: Detailed README with evaluation criteria and usage examples
- **Active Development**: 13 specifications with detailed requirements and designs
- **Good Architecture**: Well-organized source code structure with clear separation of concerns

### Critical Issues Identified
- **141 Incomplete Tasks**: Across all specifications, indicating significant unfinished work
- **Core Functionality Gaps**: Missing report generation, PR automation, and caching systems
- **Test Collection Errors**: 3 test files with collection errors need fixing
- **Excess Files**: 40+ temporary/debug files in project root need cleanup
- **Technical Debt**: TODO comments and deprecated code patterns identified

### Priority Areas for Improvement
1. **Complete Core Features**: Report generation (Task 6.1), PR automation (Tasks 7.1-7.2)
2. **Fix Test Issues**: Resolve 3 test collection errors
3. **Clean Up Project**: Remove 40+ excess files from project root
4. **Finish Specifications**: Complete 4 incomplete specs missing design/tasks
5. **Optimize Performance**: Address large repository resilience and pagination

### Quick Wins Available
- Remove excess debug/test files from project root
- Fix test collection errors
- Complete missing CLI command implementations
- Update documentation to match current functionality
- Consolidate redundant code patterns

The project is well-architected and extensively tested but needs focused effort on completing core features and cleaning up accumulated development artifacts.
