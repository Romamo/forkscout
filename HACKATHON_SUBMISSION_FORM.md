### Project Title
**Forkscout: AI-Powered GitHub Fork Analysis Tool**

### Elevator Pitch (200 characters max)
AI-powered GitHub fork analysis tool that discovers valuable features across thousands of forks in minutes, delivering 480x time savings for open source maintainers.

### About the Project

## Inspiration

Open source maintainers face an impossible challenge: discovering valuable contributions scattered across hundreds or thousands of repository forks. We witnessed maintainers spending 40+ hours manually reviewing just a fraction of their fork ecosystem, missing 95% of potentially valuable improvements. This inefficiency wastes developer time, loses community innovations, and creates barriers to collaboration.

The breaking point came when we saw a popular framework maintainer give up on reviewing 2,000+ forks because it would take months of full-time work. Meanwhile, buried in those forks were critical security fixes, performance improvements, and innovative features that could benefit millions of users. We knew there had to be a better way.

## What it does

Forkscout transforms the impossible task of manual fork analysis into an automated, intelligent process that takes minutes instead of hours:

### Specific Examples of Kiro Assistance

**1. Requirements Engineering:**
Kiro guided systematic requirements gathering using EARS format:

```markdown
# Example: AI-Powered Commit Analysis Requirements
WHEN analyzing commits THEN the system SHALL categorize each commit 
as feature, bugfix, refactor, docs, test, chore, performance, security, or other

WHEN categorizing commits THEN the system SHALL assess impact level 
as critical, high, medium, or low

WHEN explaining commits THEN the system SHALL provide clear reasoning 
for the categorization and impact assessment
```

**2. Architecture Design:**
Kiro suggested and refined the modular architecture:

```python
# Kiro-suggested architecture pattern
class CommitExplanationEngine:
    """AI-powered commit analysis orchestrator."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.categorizer = CommitCategorizer()      # Pattern-based classification
        self.impact_assessor = ImpactAssessor()     # Multi-factor analysis
        self.explanation_generator = ExplanationGenerator()  # AI explanations
        self.formatter = ExplanationFormatter()     # User-friendly output
```

**3. Test-Driven Development:**
Kiro generated comprehensive test suites:

```python
# Kiro-generated test with human refinement
@pytest.mark.parametrize("message,expected_category", [
    ("feat: add user authentication", CategoryType.FEATURE),
    ("fix: resolve memory leak", CategoryType.BUGFIX),
    ("docs: update API documentation", CategoryType.DOCUMENTATION),
    # Human-added edge cases
    ("feat!: breaking change in API", CategoryType.FEATURE),
    ("fix(security): patch SQL injection", CategoryType.SECURITY),
])
def test_commit_categorization(message, expected_category):
    """Test commit categorization with various message formats."""
    commit = Commit(message=message, files=["example.py"])
    result = categorizer.categorize(commit)
    assert result.category == expected_category
```

**4. Quality Enforcement:**
Steering rules automatically enforced best practices:

```markdown
# TDD Steering Rule (enforced throughout development)
- Write failing tests first
- Implement minimal code to pass
- Refactor and improve
- Maintain 90%+ test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
```
