# Advanced Kiro Integration: Specs, Hooks, and Steering

## Overview

This document demonstrates the sophisticated integration between Kiro's three core automation features: **Specs** (requirements and design), **Hooks** (automated workflows), and **Steering** (development guidelines). The Forkscout project showcases how these components work together to create a comprehensive AI-assisted development environment.

```

## Component Integration Details

### 1. Specs → Hooks Integration

**How Specs Drive Hook Automation**

Specs define what needs to be built, and hooks automate the validation and maintenance of those specifications:

#### Example: Spec Validation Hook
```json
{
  "name": "Spec Validation and Consistency Checking",
  "trigger": {
    "patterns": [".kiro/specs/**/*.md", ".kiro/steering/**/*.md"]
  },
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "Validate Spec Structure",
      "validation_rules": [
        "requirements.md exists",
        "design.md exists", 
        "tasks.md exists",
        "proper markdown formatting",
        "requirement numbering consistency"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Real Impact**: When any of the 14+ specs in the project are modified, the hook automatically validates:
- Structural consistency across all specs
- Requirement-to-task traceability
- Cross-reference integrity
- Markdown formatting standards

#### Example: Documentation Update Hook
```json
{
  "name": "Documentation Updates on Feature Changes",
  "trigger": {
    "patterns": ["src/**/*.py", ".kiro/specs/**/*.md"]
  },
  "ai_assistance": {
    "tasks": [
      {
        "name": "Generate Docstrings",
        "prompt": "Generate comprehensive docstrings for new functions and classes"
      },
      {
        "name": "Update Feature Documentation", 
        "prompt": "Update documentation to reflect new features and changes"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Real Impact**: When implementing tasks from specs, the hook automatically:
- Updates API documentation for new features
- Generates docstrings for new code
- Updates README examples
- Maintains changelog consistency

### 2. Steering → Hooks Integration

**How Steering Rules Guide Hook Behavior**

The 19 steering files define development standards that hooks automatically enforce:

#### Code Quality Enforcement
**Steering Rule** (from `code-quality.md`):
```markdown
## Linting and Formatting
- **Ruff**: Use for linting, import sorting, and code analysis
- **Black**: Use for consistent code formatting
- **mypy**: Use for static type checking
```

**Hook Implementation**:
```json
{
  "name": "Code Quality Checks and Formatting",
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "Format Code with Black",
      "command": "uv run black --check src/ tests/ scripts/",
      "auto_fix": {
        "enabled": true,
        "command": "uv run black src/ tests/ scripts/"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "Lint with Ruff", 
      "command": "uv run ruff check src/ tests/ scripts/",
      "auto_fix": {
        "enabled": true,
        "command": "uv run ruff check --fix src/ tests/ scripts/"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Testing Standards Enforcement
**Steering Rule** (from `tdd.md`):
```markdown
## Test-Driven Development (TDD) Guidelines
- Follow strict Test-Driven Development practices
- Use `pytest` as the primary testing framework
- Maintain minimum 90% test coverage
```

**Hook Implementation**:
```json
{
  "name": "Comprehensive Test Automation",
  "actions": [
    {
      "name": "Unit Tests",
      "command": "uv run pytest tests/unit/ -v --tb=short --maxfail=10",
      "coverage": {
        "enabled": true,
        "min_coverage": 85,
        "fail_under": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Security Standards Enforcement
**Steering Rule** (from `security.md`):
```markdown
## Security Guidelines
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or passwords
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper input validation
```

**Hook Implementation**:
```json
{
  "name": "Security Check with Bandit",
  "command": "uv run bandit -r src/ -f json",
  "validation_rules": [
    "no hardcoded secrets",
    "proper input validation",
    "secure error handling"
  ]
}
```

### 3. Hooks → Specs Integration

**How Hooks Maintain Spec Integrity**

Hooks ensure that implementations stay aligned with specifications:

#### Task Status Validation
When code changes are made, hooks validate that:
- Implemented features match spec requirements
- Task completion criteria are met
- Design decisions are properly documented

#### Requirement Traceability
Hooks maintain traceability between:
- Requirements in specs
- Implementation in code
- Tests that validate requirements
- Documentation that explains features

### 4. Steering → Specs Integration

**How Steering Rules Influence Spec Creation**

Steering rules guide how specs are written and structured:

#### Spec Management Rules
**Steering Rule** (from `spec-management.md`):
```markdown
## Default Spec Behavior
All planning and task management should default to the current spec unless explicitly requested otherwise.
```

**Impact on Specs**: This rule influenced the creation of the hackathon submission spec, which consolidated multiple related tasks into a single comprehensive spec rather than creating separate specs for each component.

#### Task Management Rules
**Steering Rule** (from `task-management.md`):
```markdown
## Task Status Preservation
Never modify tasks that are marked as completed [x] or in progress [-].
```

**Impact on Specs**: This rule ensures spec integrity by preventing retroactive changes to completed work, maintaining accurate development history.

## Complex AI-Assisted Development Patterns

### Pattern 1: Spec-Driven Feature Development

**Workflow**:
1. **Spec Creation**: AI assists in creating comprehensive requirements and design
2. **Hook Validation**: Automated validation ensures spec quality
3. **Implementation**: AI-assisted coding following steering guidelines
4. **Automated Testing**: Hooks run comprehensive test suites
5. **Documentation**: AI generates and updates documentation
6. **Quality Assurance**: Hooks enforce code quality standards

3. **Specs** include quality requirements
4. **AI** suggests improvements based on all three

**Example**: The test suite stabilization spec:
- **Steering**: Defined TDD practices and testing standards
- **Specs**: Created comprehensive testing requirements
- **Hooks**: Automated test execution and coverage reporting
- **AI**: Generated test cases and identified coverage gaps

### Pattern 3: Documentation-Driven Development

**Integration Flow**:
1. **Specs** define documentation requirements
2. **Steering** establishes documentation standards
3. **Hooks** automatically generate and update documentation
4. **AI** ensures documentation quality and completeness

**Example**: API documentation maintenance:
- **Specs**: Required comprehensive API documentation
- **Steering**: Defined docstring standards and formats
- **Hooks**: Automatically generated API docs on code changes

    # Use spec context for comprehensive documentation
    spec_context = specs.get_related_requirements(code_changes)
    
    # Generate documentation with AI
    generated_docs = ai.generate_documentation(
        code_changes, 
        spec_context, 
        doc_standards
    )
    
    # Validate and apply through hooks
    hooks.validate_and_apply_documentation(generated_docs)
```

### Workflow 3: Quality-Driven Development

        # Get next task from spec
        task = specs.get_next_task()
        
        # Generate implementation following steering rules
        implementation = ai.generate_implementation(task, steering.get_rules())
        
        # Validate through hooks
        validation_result = hooks.validate_implementation(implementation)
        
        if validation_result.passed:
            # Auto-generate tests
            tests = ai.generate_tests(implementation, task.requirements)
            
            # Auto-generate documentation
            docs = ai.generate_documentation(implementation, task)
            
            # Mark task complete
            specs.mark_task_complete(task)
        else:
